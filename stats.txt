Omnific — Stat List (Feed The Beast)

Conventions
- Keys use snake_case.
- _pct = percentage-based modifier (additive within a stat category by default).
- _flat = flat/absolute value.
- Units suffixes: _m = meters, _s = seconds, _ms = milliseconds.

Core hook stats (MVP-ready per plan)
- damage_pct: Increases base weapon damage.
- fire_rate_pct: Increases shots per second.
- crit_chance_pct: Chance to crit.
- crit_multiplier_pct: Increases crit damage multiplier (base ~200%).
- lifesteal_pct: Heal for a % of damage dealt.
- knockback_power_pct: Scales knockback impulse applied on hit.
- ray_visual_speed_pct: Visual tracer/beam speed (cosmetic, feel-good).

Offense (extended)
- headshot_multiplier_pct: Extra damage on weakspots (if implemented).
- armor_shred_pct: Temporarily reduces enemy damage resistance.
- boss_damage_pct: Extra damage to elites/bosses.
- overkill_carry_pct: Portion of excess damage transfers to a nearby target.
- chain_count: Number of extra targets a shot can chain to (if chaining is added).
- chain_range_m: Max range to seek next target for chaining.
- explosion_on_kill_damage_pct: On-kill radial damage as % of base (if added).
- explosion_on_kill_radius_m: Radius of that on-kill effect.
- stagger_threshold_pct: Enemies become finisher-eligible at a higher HP%.
- weakspot_size_pct: Makes weakspot hit detection more forgiving (if used).

Tempo/Handling
- recoil_recovery_pct: Faster return to aim baseline (if recoil is used).
- swap_speed_pct: Faster weapon swap (future-proof if multiple weapons).
- aim_move_penalty_pct: Reduces slow while aiming (if present).
- heat_management_pct: Mitigates overheating/penalties (if heat system added).

Devour-centric
- devour_range_m: Effective range to trigger Devour.
- devour_cast_speed_pct: Faster execution/animation, if any.
- devour_heal_pct_maxhp: Heal as % of max HP on Devour.
- devour_xp_bonus_pct: Extra XP granted by Devour.
- devour_coin_bonus_pct: Extra coins granted by Devour.

Survivability
- max_hp_flat: Increases maximum HP.
- hp_regen_flat: Passive HP per second.
- heal_on_kill_flat: Flat heal per enemy killed.
- damage_reduction_pct: Reduces incoming damage.
- armor_flat: Flat damage reduction before % reductions.
- iframes_duration_ms: Brief invulnerability after taking damage.
- knockback_resistance_pct: Reduces knockback taken.

Mobility
- move_speed_pct: Increases movement speed.
- acceleration_pct: Faster speed ramp-up.
- sprint_speed_pct: Higher sprint speed (if sprinting is enabled).
- jump_height_pct: Higher jumps (if relevant).

Economy/Meta
- xp_gain_pct: Increases XP from drops.
- coin_gain_pct: Increases coins from drops.
- luck_pct: Improves drop quality/elite odds (design-defined).
- pickup_magnet_radius_m: Increases suction radius for XP/coins.
- pickup_suction_speed_pct: Faster homing speed of pickups.
- reroll_count: Extra rerolls when selecting upgrades.
- choice_count_flat: Adds extra choices in upgrade selections.
- elite_spawn_chance_pct: Increases elite frequency (risk lever).

Control/Utility
- slow_power_pct: Strength of slows you apply.
- stun_duration_ms: Duration increase for any stuns you apply.
- freeze_chance_pct: Chance to hard-freeze (if added, keep rare/capped).
- taint_radius_m: Radius of a weakening aura (if added).
- vision_contrast_boost: Purely visual UI/FX contrast boost.

Notes
- Recommended stacking: additive within each stat, multiplicative across stat groups to curb runaway scaling.
- Suggested soft caps (tune later): fire_rate_pct after +150%, move_speed_pct after +60%, hard-CC chances capped around 60–80%.
